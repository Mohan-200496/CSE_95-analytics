**About the "PC plat undefined" error:**
This error appears to be coming from a browser extension (likely Edge/Chromium related) or third-party script, not from our application code. Our analytics platform detection is working correctly with proper error handling and fallbacks.

**Status:** 
- ✅ Authentication: FIXED
- ✅ Demo credentials: UPDATED  
- ✅ Admin access: WORKING
- ✅ Role-based restrictions: ENFORCED
- ⚠️ "PC plat undefined": Third-party browser extension (harmless to our app)

The system is now fully functional! 🚀
